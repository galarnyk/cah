===============================================================================
Write up product statement, objectives, stakeholders and deliverables
* Jim|May need to meet with a TA/Project Manager for this? Not sure...
* Jim|It would be good for us to put it into project-info.txt so we can reference it 
Get an android activity of the game board with a simple background

* Jim|I'm thinking fat-server is easiest as it's a long test cycle on android clients
Setup build environment for android client
Setup Unit-Test environment for android client
Pick language & environment for server
	-Jim|I'm thinking Go (golang.org) for server side language, easy
	non-blocking I/O and built for this kind of thing
Setup Unit-Test environment for server
