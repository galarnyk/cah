Project Problem Statement
Members: Christina Atallah, Kalena Galarnyk, James Miller, Eric Templin

Problem Statement:
Many people enjoy playing a game called "Cards Against Humanity," but the
physical cards are often forgotten or sold out. 


Project Objectives:
Our team intends to create a mobile phone version that can be
played with friends in the spirit of the original game.


Stakeholders: 
Developers, Fans of 'Cards Against Humanity', Mobile Phone Users, 'Cards Against Humanity' creators, 


Project Deliverables: 
Our software will allow the users to play 'Cards Against Humanity' on their
mobile phones with people nearby without the physical deck.
It will emulate the experience of the actual game as closely as possible.
